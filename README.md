# AI_Sudoku_Solver

Proof of concept for my solver which should hopefully turn into an app. Utilizes ML model to recognize digits that are isolated from pictures of sudoku puzzles. It isn't perfect, the model still gets incorrect values sometimes, even after trying different models. Very messy currently, might refactor later if I can figure out how to turn this into an android application.
